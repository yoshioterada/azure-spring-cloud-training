Access Spring Boot applications logs to understand common issues.

## Configure log aggregation

There are actually three ways to access your application's logs: [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois), [Azure Events Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois), and [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois). We will focus here on Log Analytics as it's the most common one, and as it's integrated into Azure Spring Cloud.

[Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois) is part of Azure Monitor, which is well-integrated into Azure Spring Cloud, and which we will also use for metrics monitoring.

- Go to the [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azurespringcloud-github-judubois).
- Search for "Log Analytics workspaces" in the search box.
- Create a new workspace in your Azure Spring Cloud ressource group.

- Now that the Log analytics workspace has been created, we must configure our Azure Spring Cloud cluster instance to send its data to this workspace.
- Go to the "Overview" page of your Azure Spring Cloud cluster, and select "Diagnostic settings" in the menu.
- Click on "Add diagnostic setting" and configure your cluster to send all its logs to the Log analytics workspace that we just created.

## Query application logs

Logs are now available in the "Logs" menu of you Azure Spring Cloud cluster.

This is a shortcut to the Logs Analytics workspace that was created earlier, so you can access that workspace through both menus.

This workspace allows to do queries on the aggregated logs, the most common one being to get the latest log from a specific application:

__Important:__ Spring Boot applications logs have a dedicated `AppPlatformLogsforSpring` type.

As we called the application in the [previous guide](../02-build-a-simple-spring-boot-microservice/README.md) "simple-microservice", here is how to get its 50 most recent logs of the `AppPlatformLogsforSpring` type for this application:

```
AppPlatformLogsforSpring
| where AppName == "simple-microservice"
| limit 50
```
